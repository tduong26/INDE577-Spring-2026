# rice_ml

`rice_ml` is a from-scratch machine learning library designed for educational and exploratory purposes. It provides clean, readable implementations of core machine learning algorithms across supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and data preprocessing, with a strong emphasis on mathematical clarity and algorithmic transparency.

This package is intended for learning, experimentation, and deeper understanding of how machine learning algorithms work internally — without relying on black-box frameworks.

---

## Design Philosophy

The guiding principles of `rice_ml` are:

- **From-scratch implementations** (NumPy-based, minimal abstraction)
- **Mathematical transparency** over performance optimization
- **Modular structure** that mirrors standard ML taxonomy
- **Readable code** suitable for coursework and self-study
- **Explicit assumptions and limitations**

> This library is not intended to replace production ML frameworks, but to explain them.

Each module is self-contained and mirrors the structure and behavior of its theoretical counterpart.

## Processing

### `processing/`

Utilities for preparing data before and after modeling.

**Includes:**

- Feature standardization and normalization
- Common preprocessing transformations (scaling, train/test splitting)
- Post-processing helpers for model outputs (accuracy, MSE, R², confusion matrix)

These utilities are intentionally minimal and designed to expose how preprocessing affects downstream algorithms.

---

## Supervised Learning

### `supervised_learning/`

Implements classic supervised learning algorithms where labeled data is available.

**Algorithms included:**

#### Linear Regression
Closed-form and gradient-based solutions for regression tasks.

#### Logistic Regression
Binary classification using sigmoid activation and log-loss.

#### Gradient Descent
Generic optimization routines shared across models.

#### k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Distance-based classification with customizable metrics.

#### Distance Metrics
Euclidean and related distance functions used across models.

#### Perceptron
Linear binary classifier using mistake-driven updates.

#### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Feedforward neural network with backpropagation.

#### Decision Trees
Tree-based models using greedy recursive splitting.

#### Regression Trees
Tree-based regression using variance reduction.

#### Ensemble Methods
Foundations for combining multiple weak learners.

> These implementations emphasize algorithmic logic over performance tricks.

---

## Unsupervised Learning

### `unsupervised_learning/`

Implements algorithms that discover structure without labels.

**Algorithms included:**

#### K-Means Clustering
Centroid-based clustering using Euclidean distance.

#### DBSCAN
Density-based clustering with explicit noise detection.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Variance-based dimensionality reduction via eigen-decomposition.

#### Community Detection (Label Propagation)
Graph-based clustering using connectivity and local consensus.

> These methods illustrate different definitions of similarity: distance, density, variance, and connectivity.

## Educational Focus

The `rice_ml` package is especially suited for:

- Machine learning coursework
- Algorithm walkthroughs and demos
- Understanding tradeoffs and assumptions
- Debugging intuition for real-world ML tools
- Connecting math to code

Each algorithm is implemented in a way that mirrors its mathematical definition as closely as possible.

---

## Limitations

- Not optimized for large-scale or production use
- Limited numerical stability safeguards
- Focuses on clarity rather than speed
- Assumes clean, well-structured input data

> These tradeoffs are intentional and aligned with the library's educational goals.

## Conclusion

`rice_ml` provides a cohesive, transparent collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from first principles.

By organizing supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and preprocessing under a single consistent interface, the package serves as a practical companion for understanding how machine learning works.
