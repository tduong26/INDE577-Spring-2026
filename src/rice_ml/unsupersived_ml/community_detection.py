"""
Graph Community Detection — Built from Scratch
A collection of lightweight, self-contained community detection methods
implemented without external dependencies such as sklearn or scipy.
The emphasis is on instructional transparency and conceptual clarity
over production-level performance.

Algorithms included:
- Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA)

Graphs are represented internally as adjacency lists or NumPy-backed
adjacency matrices.

    Label Propagation community detection algorithm.

    Each node starts with a unique label. At each iteration, nodes update
    their label to the most frequent label among their neighbors. The

    This implementation is deterministic given a fixed node order.
